## Describe
The repositories include three folders:
1. AOCpoint: The pointwise active instances selection model for ordinal classification data. This model is targeted to select the critical/informative instances for the query pairs building in pairwise query active ordinal classification.  It can also be used as an pointwise query active learning method for ordinal classification.
The file "mord" is the module of Logistic All Threshold ordinal classification model.
2. AOCpair : The pairwise query active ordinal classification models. Where the AOC-ECM is the proposed Expected Cost Minimization Based pairwise query active ordinal classification method.
3. datasets: Eight ordinal classification data sets.
